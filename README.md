# iOS App for My Graduation Project

My graduation project consists of an indoor living space quality measurement device. It transmits data about the quality of your living conditions to a server, which you can access by using an iOS app. It uses dust, light, humidity, and gas sensors to give you a "living conditions score" which you can then strive to improve. You can also delve deeper into your data by analyzing each metric separately.

This is the iOS app that pulls data from the server and presents it in a user-friendly way. It is written entirely in Swift.
